## 🧭 What we do

Oztech Software is the product arm of the Oztech ecosystem.

We design and build:

- **SaaS platforms** for clinics, creators, and urban services.  
- **Intelligent systems** integrated into real products and workflows.  
- **Ethical & auditable infrastructure** for AI-driven and critical systems.

---

## 🏢 Divisions & ecosystem

- **Oztech Software** – products & platforms  
  - Veterinary ERPs and client portals  
  - Creator and social monetization platforms  
  - Mobility, parking and financial control systems  

- **Oztech Labs** – independent research lab focused on synthetic neurons, temporal AI, ethical guardians and energy-aware computation, hosted on a separate GitLab / infrastructure.

- **Teseu Sentinel** – verifiable audit & security layer using Git/Merkle-based attestations for AI decisions and legacy systems.  
  Core repositories live in a dedicated Teseu Sentinel GitHub organization. <!-- TODO: add link to Teseu org/repo here -->

## 🛠 Tech stack

We work with a pragmatic stack, tuned for long-term maintainability:

- **Backend**: primarily Go,Python and Rust, with Node.js/TypeScript where appropriate.  
- **Frontend & Web Apps**: Next.js (React/TypeScript), React.  
- **Mobile & Multiplatform**: Flutter.  
- **Data & Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, MinIO/S3, Docker, GitHub Actions.  

Research-specific architectures and experimental modules (NHF, Janus, ChronoBrane, EAC/HDC, etc.) live under **Oztech Labs** and are only exposed here through stable, product-ready interfaces.

## 🌱 Principles

- **Ethics-first** – every intelligent system must be auditable, explainable and aligned with human oversight.  
- **Energy-aware** – we design models and infrastructure to reduce waste and respect hardware and planetary limits.  
- **Independent** – research and products built without vendor lock-in, with clear boundaries between commercial and lab work.  
- **Real-world impact** – tools must survive outside the lab: clinics, creators, streets, and finance.

## 🗂 How we use this organization

This GitHub organization is the home for Oztech’s product codebases:

- Each major product typically has repositories for backend, frontend, mobile apps and infrastructure.  
- Shared libraries and services are grouped so they can be reused across multiple platforms.  
- Security-sensitive and experimental research lives under **Oztech Labs** (separate GitLab / infrastructure), with only stable or public-facing components mirrored here when appropriate.
